# **Shoe Inventory - Object Oriented Programming**
JavaScript and HTML

In this project I created an object constructor function with properties such as Name, Product code, Value and Quantity.
I also added a few different shoe brands with each of the above values and placed them in an array, in order to 
create functions that can interact with the above.
This project queried data that was held within the code and allows the user to make changes to specific shoe brands' values using prompts.
It also returns specific data such as which shoe has the highest or lowest value, plus a function to query the ascending and descending order.

**Output**
